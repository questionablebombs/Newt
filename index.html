<h2> How diffrent eletric type pokemon create electricity </h2>

<h2> Heliolisk </h2>
<h3> Heliolisk is a pokemon introduced in Gen 6 or the Kalos region. This pokemon is an eletric type with a unique way to create electricity. Heliolisks don't need to eat food all they need to do is sun bathe because they use solar energy as a food source just like plants do. This is based off of solar panels.

<h2> Wattrel and Kilowattrel </h2>
<h3> Wattrel and Kilowattrel are both eletric flying types that were introduced in Gen 9 or the Paldean region and they both have the ability Wind Power. This ability makes it so when they are hit by a flying type move their next eletric type move is boosted or in a more practical use when the wind blows on them it gets generated into electricity. This is based off of wind turbines in real life.
