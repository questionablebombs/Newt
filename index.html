<h2> How diffrent eletric type pokemon create electricity </h2>

<h2> Heliolisk </h2>
<h3> Heliolisk is a pokemon introduced in Gen 6 or the Kalos region. This pokemon is an eletric type with a unique way to create electricity. Heliolisks don't need to eat food all they need to do is sun bathe because they use solar energy as a food source just like plants do. This is based off of solar panels.

<h2> Pikachu </h2>
<h3> Pikachu is probably the most famous example of a pokemon, introduced in Gen 1 or the Kanto region pikachu can discharge huge amounts of electricity that it stores in its red cheeks. When sleeping Pikachu's red cheeks generate electricity from the nutritien it gets from eating. Pikachu can also temporarily absorb and use large amounts of electricity whether that is from batteries or from other pokemons moves. </h3>

<h2> Wattrel and Kilowattrel </h2>
<h3> Wattrel and Kilowattrel are both eletric flying types that were introduced in Gen 9 or the Paldean region and they both have the ability Wind Power. This ability makes it so when they are hit by a flying type move their next eletric type move is boosted or in a more practical use when the wind blows on them it gets generated into electricity. This is based off of wind turbines in real life.
